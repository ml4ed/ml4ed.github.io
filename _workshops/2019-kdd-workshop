Many people believe in education because of its power to maximize human potential, and transform lives; 
it is also a critical component of our society, since both school education and lifelong education play a central role 
in the development of the worldâ€™s workforce. However, compared to other applications of significant societal impact 
(e.g., healthcare, transportation, and social sciences), education remains a highly under-explored application field by 
the data mining and machine learning research communities.

Our workshop focuses on the use of deep learning to improve education; we aim at bringing together experts in the interrelated 
groups of machine learning, cognitive science, educational psychology, human computer interaction, and intelligent systems. 
In particular, we will focus on the following topics:

Utilizing machine learning to expand learning beyond the privileged few to remote corners of the world. 
Using data mining to create alternatives in higher education that will prepare adults for the careers they want without the burden of excessive student debt.
Using data mining to help reverse the trend in K-12 of increasing spending to achieve the same learning outcomes. 
Improving the interpretability of deep learning methods and using them to extract insights on how to improve learning outcomes.
Incorporating cognitive and behavioral science principles in the development of deep learning methods to improve their performance.
