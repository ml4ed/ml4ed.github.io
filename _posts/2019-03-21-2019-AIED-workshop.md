title: 2019 AIED Workshop on Intelligent Textbooks
---

First Workshop on Intelligent Textbooks
@ The 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED’2019)

We are happy to announce that we will be organizing a full-day workshop at AIED 2019. 
Details on the workshop will be updated soon. AIED 2019 will be held in Chicago, IL, USA during June 25-29, 2019. 
See [here](https://caed-lab.com/aied2019/index.html).

--------------------------- WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION -------------------------

Textbooks have evolved over the last several decades in many aspects. Most textbooks can be 
accessed online, many of them freely. They often come with libraries of supplementary educational 
resources or online educational services built on top of them. As a result of these enrichments, 
new research challenges and opportunities emerge that call for the application of AIEd methods 
to enhance digital textbooks and learners’ interaction with them. Therefore, we ask: How to 
facilitate the access to textbooks and improve the reading process? What can be extracted from 
textbook content and data-mined from the logs of students interacting with it? This workshop seeks 
research contributions addressing these and other research questions related to the idea of 
intelligent textbooks. It aims at bringing together researchers working on different aspects of 
learning technologies to establish intelligent textbooks as a new, interdisciplinary research field.

--------------------------- TOPICS OF INTEREST --------------------------- 

The workshop themes include but are not limited to:

* Modelling and representation of textbooks: examining the prerequisite and semantic structure of 
textbooks to enhance their readability;

* Analysis and mining of textbook usage logs: analyzing the patterns of learners’ use of textbooks 
to obtain insights on learning and the pedagogical value of textbook content;

* Collaborative technologies: building and deploying social components of digital textbooks that 
enable learners to interact with not only content but other learners;

* Generation, manipulation, and presentation: exploring and testing different formats and forms of 
textbook content to find the most effective means of presenting different knowledge;

* Assessment and personalization: developing methods that can generate assessments and enhance 
textbooks with adaptive support to meet the needs of every learner using the textbook;

* Content curation and enrichment: sorting through external resources on the web and finding the 
relevant resources to augment the textbook and provide additional information for learners;   

* Knowledge visualization: augmenting textbooks with concept maps, open learner models and other 
knowledge-rich extensions;

* Smart interactive content: extending online textbooks with various kinds of smart interactive 
content to improve learning, engagement, learned modeling, and personalization;

* Intelligent information retrieval and question-answering for digital textbooks.
